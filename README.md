# LED-contoller

I am controlling the LEDs with my hand gestures. 
For the arduino part:
I) I am using Arduino UNO board and a COM3 port.
II) Connecting the negative terminal of the LEDs to the ground of arduino board and the positive terminals to the 13,12,~11,~10,~9 terminal. 
III) Now on the Arduino IDE, click on the 'file' then on 'examples' . After that click on 'firmata' and then lastly on 'StandardFirmata'. This is a source code.
IV) Now uploading this code into arduino board. 
That's all.
